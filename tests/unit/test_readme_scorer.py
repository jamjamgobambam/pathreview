        # Project Name

        A comprehensive project description for a full-stack portfolio review
        assistant. This tool ingests a candidate's resume and GitHub projects,
        analyzes the quality signals in each repository, and produces
        actionable, human-readable feedback that helps developers present their
        work more effectively to hiring managers and technical reviewers.

        ## Installation

        Getting started takes only a few minutes. Clone the repository, create a
        virtual environment, install the dependencies, and run the setup script.
        The project targets Python 3.9 and above and has been tested on macOS,
        Linux, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/example/project.git
        cd project
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        make setup
        ```

        ## Usage

        After installation, start the development servers and open the web
        interface in your browser. The example below shows how to score a single
        README programmatically, which is the most common way to use the library
        inside your own automation or continuous integration pipeline.

        ```python
        import package

        scorer = package.ReadmeScorer()
        result = scorer.run("path/to/README.md")
        print(result.overall_score)
        ```

        Each run returns a structured result object containing the word count,
        the detected sections, and an overall quality score between zero and one.
        You can wire these numbers into dashboards, pull request checks, or
        automated review comments so contributors get feedback immediately.

        ## Features

        - Feature 1: automatic word-count and readability scoring for any README
        - Feature 2: section detection for installation, usage, and demo links
        - Feature 3: badge and continuous integration status recognition
        - Feature 4: an extensible plugin system for custom quality heuristics
        - Feature 5: export to JSON, Markdown, and richly formatted HTML reports

        The scoring engine is deliberately transparent. Every signal it measures
        is documented, and the weighting for each component can be overridden
        through a simple configuration file, so teams can tune the rubric to
        match their own definition of a high-quality project README.

        ## Tech Stack

        - Python 3.9 for the core scoring library and command-line interface
        - FastAPI for the asynchronous backend application programming interface
        - PostgreSQL for durable storage of historical scores and review results
        - Redis for caching expensive computations and rate-limiting requests
        - React and Vite for the fast, modern single-page front-end experience

        This stack was chosen for its balance of developer productivity, runtime
        performance, and long-term maintainability across a growing codebase.

        ## Live Demo

        [Try it here](https://demo.example.com) to see the scorer analyze a real
        repository in your browser without installing anything on your machine.

        ![Build Status](https://example.com/badge.svg)
        ![Coverage](https://example.com/coverage.svg)

        ## Configuration

        All runtime behavior can be adjusted through environment variables or a
        small YAML configuration file placed in the project root. You can change
        the scoring thresholds, enable or disable individual heuristics, point
        the application at a different database, and configure logging verbosity
        without touching any source code. Sensible defaults are provided so the
        tool works out of the box for most repositories on the very first run.

        ## Contributing

        Contributions are welcome and appreciated. Please read the contributing
        guide, follow the branch naming and commit message conventions, run the
        full test suite, and open a pull request describing the change you made
        and the reasoning behind it. Every submission is reviewed by a maintainer
        before it is merged into the main development branch of the project. If
        you are unsure where to begin, browse the open issues labeled good first
        issue for approachable, well-scoped tasks that make an excellent starting
        point for your very first contribution to this growing open project.
