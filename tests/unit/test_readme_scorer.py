        # Project Name

        A comprehensive project description that covers all the important aspects of
        the application. This project is designed to help developers manage their
        portfolio reviews and get feedback on their work. It uses modern web
        technologies and follows best practices for software development.

        ## Installation

        To install this project, follow the steps below. Make sure you have Python
        3.9 or higher installed on your system before proceeding with the setup.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/example/project.git
        cd project
        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
        ```

        After installation, copy the example environment file and configure your
        settings accordingly:

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

        ## Usage

        Once installed, you can start the application with the following command.
        The server will be available at http://localhost:8000 by default.

        ```python
        import package
        package.run()
        ```

        You can also run it via the command line interface:

        ```bash
        uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
        ```

        ## Features

        This project includes a rich set of features designed to make portfolio
        review easy and thorough:

        - Feature 1: Automated README quality scoring using heuristic analysis
        - Feature 2: Skill extraction from GitHub repositories and resume text
        - Feature 3: Tech stack detection based on file extensions and imports
        - Feature 4: Bias detection in AI-generated review content
        - Feature 5: PII scrubbing to protect sensitive user information
        - Feature 6: Structured chunking for efficient RAG retrieval
        - Feature 7: Keyword and semantic search with hybrid scoring

        ## Tech Stack

        The application is built with a modern, production-ready tech stack:

        - Python 3.9 — core application language
        - FastAPI — high-performance async web framework
        - PostgreSQL — primary relational database
        - Redis — caching and session storage
        - ChromaDB — vector store for semantic search
        - SQLAlchemy — async ORM with Alembic migrations
        - OpenAI API — LLM-powered review generation
        - Pydantic v2 — data validation and settings management

        ## Architecture

        The project follows a layered architecture separating concerns cleanly
        across the API, service, agent, ingestion, and RAG layers. Each layer
        has a well-defined responsibility and communicates via typed interfaces.

        The agent orchestrator coordinates tool execution, while the RAG pipeline
        handles document ingestion, chunking, embedding, and retrieval. The API
        layer exposes RESTful endpoints secured with JWT authentication.

        ## Live Demo

        A hosted version of the application is available for exploration:

        [Try it here](https://demo.example.com)

        The demo environment is reset nightly and does not persist data between
        sessions. Feel free to explore all features without creating a real account.

        ## Contributing

        Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue before submitting a pull
        request so the change can be discussed first. All pull requests should
        include tests and pass the existing test suite.

        ## Configuration

        The application is configured via environment variables. Copy the provided
        `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values. Key settings
        include the database connection string, Redis URL, OpenAI API key, and JWT
        secret. All configuration options are documented in the example file with
        inline comments explaining their purpose and accepted values.

        ## Testing

        The test suite is split into unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests
        run without any external services and complete in under thirty seconds.
        Integration tests require the Docker services to be running.

        ```bash
        pytest tests/unit -v -m unit
        pytest tests/integration -v -m integration
        ```
