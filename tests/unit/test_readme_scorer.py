        A comprehensive project description that explains what this project does,
        who it is for, and why it exists. This library helps developers analyze
        portfolio repositories and generate structured, actionable feedback about
        code quality, documentation, and overall presentation. It is designed to be
        fast, dependency light, and easy to embed inside a larger review pipeline or
        a continuous integration workflow that runs on every push.

        ## Overview

        PathReview inspects a repository and produces a set of quality signals that
        reviewers can use to give consistent feedback. Instead of relying only on
        subjective first impressions, the tool measures concrete attributes of a
        project such as the presence of installation instructions, usage examples,
        status badges, a described technology stack, and a live demo link. Each of
        these signals contributes to an overall score between zero and one so that
        projects can be compared fairly and improvements can be tracked over time as
        a candidate iterates on their work and responds to review comments.

        ## Installation

        Install the package from PyPI using pip. The project supports all currently
        maintained versions of Python and has no heavy native dependencies, so
        installation should complete in only a few seconds on most machines.

        ```bash
        pip install package
        ```

        ## Usage

        Import the package and call the run function to score a README. The public
        interface is intentionally small so that new users can become productive
        quickly without first reading many pages of dense documentation.

        ```python
        import package
        package.run()
        ```

        The scorer returns a dictionary of results that you can serialize to JSON,
        store in a database, or render directly inside a web dashboard. Every field
        is documented in the reference guide, and the return shape is stable across
        minor releases so that you can safely depend on it in production code.

        ## Features
        - Feature 1: measures documentation completeness across many quality signals
        - Feature 2: produces a single normalized overall score for easy comparison
        - Feature 3: runs quickly and integrates cleanly with existing review tools
        - Feature 4: exposes a simple, well documented, and stable return structure
        - Feature 5: ships with an extensive suite of unit tests for confidence

        ## Tech Stack
        - Python 3.9 and newer for the core scoring library and its command line
        - FastAPI for the optional web service layer and its automatic documentation
        - PostgreSQL for durable storage of historical review results over time
        - Redis for caching expensive computations between repeated scoring runs
        - Docker and Docker Compose for reproducible local development environments

        ## Contributing

        Contributions are welcome and genuinely appreciated. Please read the
        contributing guide before opening a pull request, run the linter and the
        full test suite locally, and follow the conventional commit format for your
        messages so that the changelog can be generated automatically from history.

        ## Live Demo

        A hosted instance is available so that you can try the tool without having
        to install anything at all on your own machine. Explore the demo, upload a
        sample repository, and watch how the scoring works from end to end before
        you commit to a full local setup and configuration of your own.
