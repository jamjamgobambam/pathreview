        # PathReview

        ![Build Status](https://example.com/badge.svg)

        PathReview is a comprehensive, AI-powered portfolio review assistant that
        helps software engineers turn their GitHub profiles and resumes into
        polished, recruiter-ready portfolios. It ingests your repositories,
        analyzes the quality of your documentation, detects the technologies you
        work with, and produces actionable feedback you can apply immediately.
        This project exists because most developers have strong work that is
        poorly presented, and a good README, a clear tech stack, and a live demo
        can make the difference between a profile that gets ignored and one that
        gets an interview.

        ## Installation

        Getting started with PathReview is straightforward. First, clone the
        repository from GitHub and change into the project directory. Then create
        a virtual environment and install the dependencies using the provided
        Makefile, which wires up the database, seed data, and pre-commit hooks
        for you automatically.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ascherj/pathreview
        cd pathreview
        make setup
        ```

        The setup command creates a Python virtual environment, installs every
        backend dependency, runs the database migrations, seeds sample data, and
        installs the frontend packages with npm. Once it finishes you are ready
        to run the application locally without any further configuration.

        ## Usage

        After installation, start the backend and frontend development servers
        with a single command. The backend runs on port eight thousand and the
        frontend runs on port five thousand one hundred and seventy three. Open
        the frontend in your browser and sign in with the seeded test account to
        explore the full review workflow end to end.

        ```python
        from agent.orchestrator import Orchestrator

        orchestrator = Orchestrator()
        result = orchestrator.review(github_username="octocat")
        print(result.summary)
        ```

        For a quick example, submit any public GitHub username and PathReview
        will fetch the associated repositories, score each README, extract the
        detected skills, and return a ranked list of improvement suggestions.

        ## Features

        - Automated README quality scoring with word count analysis
        - Skill and technology detection across many programming languages
        - Resume parsing that understands multiple document formats
        - Retrieval augmented generation for grounded, context aware feedback
        - Safety filters that keep generated feedback constructive and fair
        - A responsive React frontend for browsing your review history

        ## Tech Stack

        PathReview is built with a modern, well tested technology stack. The
        backend is written in Python using FastAPI for the web layer and
        SQLAlchemy for database access. Data is stored in PostgreSQL, background
        caching uses Redis, and vector search is powered by ChromaDB. The
        frontend is a single page application written in TypeScript and React.

        - Python 3.11 and FastAPI
        - SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL
        - Redis and ChromaDB
        - TypeScript, React, and Vite

        ## Architecture

        The system is organized into clear, independent modules. The ingestion
        pipeline fetches and parses documents, the retrieval layer indexes and
        searches content, the agent orchestrator coordinates the scoring tools,
        and the safety module reviews every generated response before it reaches
        the user. Each module is covered by its own suite of fast unit tests.

        ## Live Demo

        Want to see PathReview in action before installing anything? A hosted
        instance is available online so you can explore the interface with sample
        data. [Try it here](https://demo.example.com) and walk through a complete
        portfolio review in just a few minutes.

        ## Contributing

        Contributions are welcome and appreciated. Please read the contributing
        guide, create a branch that follows the naming convention, write tests
        for your changes, and make sure the full check suite passes before you
        open a pull request. We review every contribution carefully and aim to
        respond to new pull requests within a couple of business days.
